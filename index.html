       <p>My name is Olivia. I'm a recent college graduate from Salem College with a degree in Exercise Science and Spanish minor. Originally, I'm from Kenya, but I was born in upstate New Jersey, raised North Carolina and moved to Texas shortly after graduating college. I looked for employment during my first few months of living in Dallas, and was introduced to computer programming. I decided to shift gears and expand my knowledge in the field and enroll in a bootcamp!</p>

       <p>I play the piano and guitar, I'm a dancer, and I love to travel! In my spare time I enjoy streaming Netflix and Hulu (I can't pick one), working out, and napping. Fun fact: In high school I had the opportunity to tour the white house and shake former President Barack Obama's hand!</p>
